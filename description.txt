The Ebonian Mod is a WIP Mod that plans on adding random nonsense with an unsurprising focus on... the Corruption and Crimson (They're far from everything though!)

Currently the mod contains 4 bossfights, 85 items and over 30 enemies but will grow with time.

NO MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBILITY!!!!!!!!!!!
